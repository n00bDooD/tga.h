A small, simple loader of targa images, licensed under the MIT license.
The goal is to create a tiny helper, which can be guaranteed to be bug-free.

Current issues/gotchas:
 * Image data, image identification field and color map data WILL be in little-endian order on load
   regardless of the host endianness. The header is converted to host-endian.
 * ALL saved data WILL be in host-endian, instead of little-endian (which is what the spec says)
 * No decoding of RLE is performed, to keep implementation simple.
 * No targa-extensions etc is supported.

TODO: 
 * Fix endianness of saved image buffers (?)
 * Fix endianness of saved headers.
 * Compile & test on non-x86(_64) + gcc + linux
 * Shared lib/statically linked lib (? Might not be worth the hassle)
